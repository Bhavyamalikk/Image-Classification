# Image-Classification
### DESCRIPTION:
CIFAR-10 Dataset has 10 different categories of images in it. There are a total of 60000 images of 10 different classes naming Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck. All the images are of size 32Ã—32. There are in total 50000 train images and 10000 test images.


### TASK:
The task is to classify the images into their respective category classes.


### OUTLINE:
1. Importing the libraries.
2. Splitting the dataset into train and test while loading it.
3. Converting 2D array into 1D array.
4. Normalize the training data.
5. Building an ANN model and flattening the data.
6. Building CNN model and apply pooling.
7. Adding layers of zeros to our input images - PADDING.
8. Evaluating the model.
9. Printing a classification report.


### END RESULTS:
1. Accuracy of the CNN model : 0.7186
2. Calculated Loss : 0.8381
